## User Stories 


## User Stories (each person writes 2 stories)

### User Story #1 - Sally wants to keep track of her assignments and wants to keep up with all of the due dates. She wants to hand things in on time so that she doesn’t get stressed out with everything. She found this software that will help her do that and she intends to use it. Since she is very well versed in technology, she goes to her laptop and opens the website that uses this software. She creates an account by inputting all of the necessary information, then she begins to see where she could start. She sees a calendar and there is a + sign up at the top right corner. She clicks on that and proceeds to fill in the information for her assignment. She inputs the class name, the assignment name, and the due date. She also color coded her assignments by class. Once everything is filled in she presses enter and it shows up on the calendar. It shows up on the date it is due and how much time she has left to do it. She can also look at her assignment in chronological order to see what is the closest thing that is due. The software helped her to do all of these and she was able to keep up with which assignment was due when and how long she would have to do it before the due date.  

### User Story #2 - Nadin 

### User Story #3 (Ashley, Mother) - Dahga
It the start of a new week and Ashley is preparing for a hectic week to start. Brian, her oldest child, has 2 doctor appointments and soccer practice everyday after school from 3:30pm - 6:00pm. Lisa, her middle child, has a ballet recital Thurday at 7:00pm. And her youngest has a basketball practice after school as well as a big basketball game Wednesday night at 5:30pm. On top of that, Ashley has an eye appointment Tuesday at 2:30pm that she can't miss or it'll be her third time this year. Ashley needs to organize and manage her time carefully this week so she doesn't forget or make any mistakes. So she makes sure to open up & input all the scheduled appointments, activities, and games Sunday night so she doesn't forget the next morning before she begins her week. When the time starts to approach before the first activity, she has scheduled an alarm to notify her an hour before the first event so that she can get everything ready and done. Now, if she has anything else scheduled after the first event, she can schedule an alarm between 5 minutes to 12 hours before so she doesn't miss anything scheduled. 


### User Story #4 (Ashley, Mother) - Dahga 


### User Story #5 (Linda, Business Owner) - Robyn 
Linda has a hectic day and realizes since the grand opening several bands have reached out and had reviews scheduled on Monday. She doesn’t know how much time she has between the reviews to complete the regular daily requirements of the brewery. Although the brewery opens at 11 am all her band reviews are 11 am and after. She just made it to the brewery at 9 am and viewed her calendar. She views the countdown clock and sees she has exactly 1.50 hours until her first review. Without eating breakfast or starting her cleaning she jumps on the jobs. She gets most of the cleaning done and her next review is at 1:30 pm and she has another every 30 min thereafter. The first review lasted 45 min, and an employee was called in sick. Linda agreed to help where needed to keep the flow of business. She realizes with the countdown clock she now has 1.1 hours until the next review and it’s always busier after lunch. With the limited time she has she is able to call the bands and ask that they do the review in front of the guests. This works out perfectly, the reviews are given a 1 – 10 score and all the customers are happy to put their vote in. Linda was able to get through the reviews and made progress with the local bands.
### User Story #6 - Robyn 
Linda decided she would work from home today for the brewery and be on call when needed. She logs into the website and reviews her calendar. She sees there is no countdown, but the business is in the summer parade in just 3 days! She forgot to put a countdown on the event. Now that she has added the countdown, she can see that she has 2 days and 12 hours left. She scrambles to the store to get things as needed and rushes her online delivery orders. The countdown helps, and when she doesn’t add it to her calendar events, she forgets about them.
